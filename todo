high prio:
    magic commands? (programming language agnostic) (can these even be implemented with an nbextension?)

low prio:
    fix tag not updating in cell-toolbar
    if cell is inserted on sideline, add the same metadata.tag as the cell below/above
    prevent pinning of "link"-cells, but not of all md cells

decide:
    run subplots when linking cells are run? (e.g. with Jupyter.notebook.execute_cells(indices))
    once(?) , when a cell with "go to..." is visible for a set time, scroll to its subplot
    move end_space and change where cells are inserted
    maybe atuomatically change scroll cell tag if subplot tag is changed?
