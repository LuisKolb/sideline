handle unpinning (where to insert?)
maybe atuomatically change scroll cell tag if subplot tag is changed?
move end_space and change where cells are inserted
once, (?) when a cell with "go to..." is visible for a set time, scroll to its subplot
run subplots when linking cells are run? Jupyter.notebook.execute_cells(indices)
flashing animation of the cell that was scrolled to
fix tag not showing in tag-toolbar when first pinned
