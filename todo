load css from .css file
handle unpinning (where to insert?)
add button to hide the apropriate subplot?
maybe atuomatically change scroll cell tag if subplot tag is changed?
move end_space and change where cells are inserted
once, (?) when a cell with "go to..." is visible for a set time, scroll to its subplot
