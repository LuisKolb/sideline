high prio:
    (magic commands: see overleaf, not practical, use metadata.tags for language-agnostic tagging and md-cells for "linking" to subplots)

low prio:
    unpinning: scroll to cell that was unpinned
    update README.mb, icon.png and sideline.yml
    if no subplot with the tag a link-cell is referencing exists, dont insert buttons on the linking cell (decide: show an error in the link-cell?)
    bugfix: paste-and-replace not adding tags
    integrate options from sideline.yml to actually do something

low low prio:
    if tag is removed, also automatically unpin cell?

decide:
    run subplots when linking cells are run? (e.g. with Jupyter.notebook.execute_cells(indices))
    once(?) , when a cell with "go to..." is visible for a set time, scroll to its subplot?
    move end_space and change where cells are inserted/restore functionality?
    maybe atuomatically change scroll cell tag if subplot tag is changed?
    if last cell with id == highest_pindex is unpinned, decrement it by one?
