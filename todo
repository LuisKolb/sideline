high prio:
    (magic commands: see overleaf, not practical, use metadata.tags for language-agnostic tagging and md-cells for "linking" to subplots)

low prio:
    fix tag not updating in cell-toolbar
    if new cell is inserted below/above inside the pinned area, add the same metadata.tag as the cell below/above

decide:
    run subplots when linking cells are run? (e.g. with Jupyter.notebook.execute_cells(indices))
    once(?) , when a cell with "go to..." is visible for a set time, scroll to its subplot
    move end_space and change where cells are inserted
    maybe atuomatically change scroll cell tag if subplot tag is changed?
