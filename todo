high prio:
    (magic commands: see overleaf, not practical, use metadata.tags for language-agnostic tagging and md-cells for "linking" to subplots)
    keep cells with the same tags together - refactor to use classes instead of ids since tags are not unique anymore

low prio:
    if new cell is inserted below/above inside the pinned area, add the same metadata.tag as the cell below/above
    update README.mb and sideline.yml
    if no subplot with the tag a link-cell is referencing exists, dont insert buttons on the linking cell (and show an error in the link-cell?)

decide:
    run subplots when linking cells are run? (e.g. with Jupyter.notebook.execute_cells(indices))
    once(?) , when a cell with "go to..." is visible for a set time, scroll to its subplot
    move end_space and change where cells are inserted
    maybe atuomatically change scroll cell tag if subplot tag is changed?
    if tag is removed, also unpin cell?
